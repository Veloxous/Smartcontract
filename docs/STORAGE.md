# Storage Layout

**Issue:** [#96](https://github.com/Heliobond/contracts/issues/96)

This document enumerates every storage key used by the Heliobond contracts, the tier each key lives in, its value type, and cost / access notes.

---

## Storage tiers

| Tier | Lifetime | Rent | Typical use |
|------|----------|------|-------------|
| **Instance** | As long as the contract instance is live | Bumped automatically on every invocation | Config set once, read often |
| **Persistent** | Until TTL expires (rent must be paid) | Charged per byte per ledger | Long-lived per-entity state |
| **Temporary** | Automatic expiry after TTL | Cheapest writes | Not currently used |

See [ADR-002](../adr/002-storage-patterns.md) for the rationale behind this partitioning.

## `project_registry`

### Instance storage

| Key (`DataKey` variant) | Rust type | Description |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `StateVersion` | `u32` | Storage schema version recorded at construction and checked before state access |
| `Whitelister` | `Address` | Address authorised to whitelist project creators and certify projects |
| `ProjectCounter` | `u32` | Auto-incrementing ID; assigned to the next project created |
| `ProposalCounter` | `u32` | Auto-incrementing governance proposal ID |

All instance keys are bumped automatically when any contract function is invoked. No explicit TTL management is required.

### Persistent storage

| Key | Rust type | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| `DataKey::Project(u32)` | `ProjectData` | Full project record keyed by ID |
| `DataKey::Whitelist(Address)` | `bool` | `true` if the address is whitelisted to create projects |
| `DataKey::Proposal(u32)` | `Proposal` | Governance proposal keyed by ID |
| `DataKey::HasVoted(u32, Address)` | `bool` | `true` if the address has voted on proposal `u32` |

#### `ProjectData` layout

```rust
pub struct ProjectData {
    pub owner: Address,                       // 32 bytes
    pub uri: String,                          // up to 512 bytes (MAX_URI_LEN)
    pub credit_quality: u32,                  // 4 bytes, range 0–100
    pub green_impact: u32,                    // 4 bytes, range 0–100
    pub maturity_date: u64,                   // 8 bytes, Unix timestamp; 0 = no maturity
    pub certification_status: CertificationStatus,  // 4 bytes (u32 repr)
}
```

Approximate encoded size per project: **~580 bytes** (worst case with 512-byte URI).

#### `Proposal` layout

```rust
pub struct Proposal {
    pub description: String,   // variable, no hard cap — keep short
    pub proposer: Address,     // 32 bytes
    pub voting_ends_at: u64,   // 8 bytes
    pub votes_for: i128,       // 16 bytes
    pub votes_against: i128,   // 16 bytes
    pub executed: bool,        // 1 byte
}
```

## `investment_vault`

### Instance storage

| Key (`VaultKey` variant) | Rust type | Description |
|--------------------------|-----------|-------------|
| `StateVersion` | `u32` | Storage schema version recorded at construction and checked before state access |
| `UsdcSac` | `Address` | USDC Stellar Asset Contract address (set at construction) |
| `Registry` | `Address` | `project_registry` contract address (set at construction) |

### Persistent storage

| Key | Rust type | Description |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| `VaultKey::TotalInvestments` | `i128` | Cumulative USDC sent to projects (does not decrease on return) |
| `VaultKey::ProjectInvestment(u32)` | `i128` | USDC invested in a specific project |
| `VaultKey::YieldPerShareAccum` | `i128` | Global yield-per-share accumulator (scaled ×10¹⁸) |
| `VaultKey::YieldDebt(Address)` | `i128` | Per-investor yield-per-share checkpoint at last claim |
| `VaultKey::InsuranceFund` | `i128` | USDC balance of the insurance fund |
| `VaultKey::InsuranceClaimed(u32)` | `bool` | `true` once an insurance payout was made for project `u32` |
| `VaultKey::TotalDeposited(Address)` | `i128` | Lifetime USDC deposited by an investor (gross, before premium) |

## Storage cost estimates

Soroban charges rent based on **entry size in bytes × ledger TTL**. The following are rough estimates using the Stellar mainnet fee schedule (subject to change):

| Entry | Size (bytes) | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| `ProjectData` (max URI) | ~580 | Dominant cost per project |
| `ProjectData` (typical URI, 64 bytes) | ~132 | Typical IPFS CID |
| `Proposal` (short description) | ~100 | Depends on description length |
| `HasVoted(id, addr)` | ~40 | One per voter per proposal |
| `YieldDebt(addr)` | ~48 | One per investor who claims yield |
| `TotalDeposited(addr)` | ~48 | One per investor who deposits |
| `ProjectInvestment(id)` | ~20 | One per funded project |

Instance storage is billed as a single ledger entry for all instance keys combined; cost scales with the total byte count.

## Access patterns

| Operation | Keys read | Keys written |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| `create_project` | `StateVersion`, `Whitelist(creator)`, `ProjectCounter` | `Project(id)`, `ProjectCounter` |
| `update_impact_score` | `Project(id)` | `Project(id)` (skipped if no-op) |
| `certify_project` | `Whitelister`, owner (via `get_owner`) | `Project(id)` |
| `create_proposal` | `ProposalCounter` | `Proposal(id)`, `ProposalCounter` |
| `cast_vote` | `HasVoted(id, addr)`, `Proposal(id)` | `Proposal(id)`, `HasVoted(id, addr)` |
| `execute_proposal` | `Proposal(id)` | `Proposal(id)` |
| `deposit` | `StateVersion`, `UsdcSac`, `InsuranceFund`, `TotalDeposited(from)` | `InsuranceFund`, `TotalDeposited(from)` |
| `withdraw` | `UsdcSac`, `YieldPerShareAccum`, `YieldDebt(from)` | — |
| `fund_project` | `Registry`, `UsdcSac`, `InsuranceFund`, `ProjectInvestment(id)`, `TotalInvestments` | `ProjectInvestment(id)`, `TotalInvestments` |
| `receive_yield` | `YieldPerShareAccum` | `YieldPerShareAccum` |
| `claim_yield` | `YieldPerShareAccum`, `YieldDebt(from)`, `UsdcSac` | `YieldDebt(from)` |
| `get_portfolio` | `YieldPerShareAccum`, `YieldDebt(addr)`, `TotalDeposited(addr)` | — |
| `claim_insurance` | `InsuranceFund`, `InsuranceClaimed(id)` | `InsuranceFund`, `InsuranceClaimed(id)` |

## Migration notes

Both contracts store `StateVersion = 1` in instance storage during construction. Public data access functions check this value before reading or writing contract state, so future code can reject unsupported layouts instead of silently decoding stale data.

Deployments that predate explicit versioning report `stored_state_version() == 0`. The owner can call `migrate_state(0)` after upgrading to code that supports v1; the current migration records `StateVersion = 1` without changing any existing persistent entries because the v1 layout matches the previous layout.

Future schema changes should add a new version number, keep old variants stable, and extend `migrate_state` with deterministic per-version upgrade steps. See [ADR-004](../adr/004-security-model.md) for the upgrade and admin model.
